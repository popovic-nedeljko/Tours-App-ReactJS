React mini application that fetches a list of tours from a third-party API and displays them to the user. The user can remove tours from the list if not interested,as well as expand and collapse text if interested

React hooks like useState and useEffect are used to manage the application's state and lifecycle. It also showcases how to fetch data from an external API using async/await syntax and how to pass functions down to child components as props to handle user actions.

This mini app is a good example of how React can be used to create a simple but effective application that interacts with an external API to provide dynamic content to the user.
